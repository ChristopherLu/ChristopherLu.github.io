## **POSTDOC POSITION**

We are looking for a creative and motivated postdoc candidate to work on **multimodal fusion for robust localization**. Past experience in multimodal fusion and/or graph neural networks is a plus. The selected candidate will join Dr. Chris Lu's group and team up with other postgraduate students to address real-world localization challenges in GPS-denied and camera-restricted environments. This position can start immediately for one year with a strong chance to be extended to three years. 

The project is research-oriented and aims to drastically improve the localization robustness in the wild by leveraging multimodal data (IMU, RF and floor plans etc.) and deep neural networks. The research is sponsored by **Huawei Research Edinburgh** which the selected candidate will work closely with and benefit from their strong engineering support and a large amount of labeled data collected in the wild.

Interested candidates may refer to our publications to understand the research we conduct:
