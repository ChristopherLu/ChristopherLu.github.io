I am an Associate Professor in Robotics and AI at the Department of Computer Science, University College London (UCL). My research centers on **Scaling Foundation Models for Embodied AI**, leveraging recent advancements in AI and machine learning to adapt foundation models for real-world applications. These models offer unparalleled context-awareness in a zero-shot manner, enabling intelligent behavior without task-specific training. My work addresses the significant challenges of deploying these foundation models in diverse and unpredictable environments, focusing on three key areas:

1. **Generalization Across Modalities** – Ensuring robust performance of AI models across various sensors used by different agents.

2. **Computational Efficiency** – Optimizing foundation models to run effectively on limited hardware resources.

3. **Human-Machine Interaction** – Facilitating seamless and intuitive interactions between AI systems, human users, and other machines.

At the core of my research is the mission to enable embodied AI systems to operate reliably in real-world settings. Discover more about my research projects on my [research page](https://christopherlu.github.io/research/).

Before coming to UCL, I was a faculty member at the University of Edinburgh and University of Liverpool. I did both my PhD study and post-doctoral in the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford. Even earlier, I received my M.Eng degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU).
