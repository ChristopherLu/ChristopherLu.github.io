I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. My research interests broadly lie in **cyber-physical systems** (e.g., mobile robots and mixed reality devices) with the goal to drastically improve their reliability, intelligence and security in the wild. These works are motivated by the urgent need of **robust localization and spatial perception** solutions for mobile robotics and wearables to deal with i. sensing degradation (e.g., bad weather & poor illumination), ii. resource constraints (e.g., payloads, compute & energy budgets) and iii. malicious faults (e.g., adversarial attacks). A representative line of research I have been recently focusing on is *4D Automotive Radar-enabled Mobile Autonomy*. 

Before coming to Edinburgh, I did both my PhD study and post-doctoral in the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford. Even earlier, I received my M.Eng degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU). 


**I have one PostDoc position to work on multimodal fusion and robust localization. Please visit the [job description](https://christopherlu.github.io/vacancies/) and drop me an email if you are interested.**
