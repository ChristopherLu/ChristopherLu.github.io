I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. My research interests broadly lie in **cyber-physical systems** (e.g., mobile robots and mixed reality devices) with the goal to drastically increasing their reliability, intelligence and security in the wild. More recently, my research focus is pivoted around how to design **robust localization and spatial perception** solutions for mobile robotics and augmented reality wearables to deal with i. visual degradation (e.g., bad weather & poor illumination), ii. resource constraints (e.g., payloads, compute & energy budgets) and iii. malicious faults (e.g., adversarial attacks).

Before coming to the Edinburgh, I did both my PhD study and post-doctoral in the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford. Even earlier, I received my M.Eng degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU). 

**I am always looking for students ([PhD](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&edition=2022&id=495), [Master by Research](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/applying/research/masters-by-research)) to join my group. Drop me an email with your CV if you are interested.**
